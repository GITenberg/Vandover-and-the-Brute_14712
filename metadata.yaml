description: Set in San Francisco, Vandover is the story of a rich young man who desires
  to become a great artist but lacks the ambition to do so. Suicide, death, gambling,
  and a lost fortune swirl around the young man, reducing him to menial work in the
  very slums he once owned. Vandover is an early example of American literary naturalism.
